Role under @Participants and @ID: use either ‘adult’, ‘child’ or ‘teenager’,
but note the relationship between the participants under @Situation.
@Situation: note where the recording took place, the kind of interaction,
and the relationship between the participants.
@Comment (information about the speakers): each speaker should be given
his/her own header. Include information regarding where the speaker
was brought up, where he/she lives now and any other places he/she
has lived for a significant period. Note regions (north-west Wales,
north-east Wales, south-west Wales, south-east Wales and mid Wales)
rather than specific areas.
@Comment: Language markers: make sure these are changed to the format
required by Talkbank (@s:w etc.) before proofreading.
@Warning: UNFINISHED TRANSCRIPT: this should be deleted after the
spot-check stage.
@Warning: Soundfile is mono: include if required.
Include any warnings or comments you deem necessary regarding any problems
with the recording or things still to be done/checked. Make sure
things to be done are done before finalising, and delete the
warning/comment when they’re done.
There is no need to include information regarding pseudonyms other than the
speakers’. Delete superfluous information regarding pseudonyms
before proofread if necessary.
The readme file should note that the first five minutes of each recording
have been edited out. This information needn’t be included in the
transcript headers.
Group, SES and education under @ID: to be discussed further in light of
statistical analysis of the questionnaires.

further in accordance with the above.
