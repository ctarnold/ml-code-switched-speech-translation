This folder contains pre-final versions of the Miami corpus, under version control (git).

The alpha folder contains versions that have been proofread, and the beta folder contains versions that have been straightened and converted to precode format.  Neither of these folders needs to be touched - the files in them are simply for the record.

The Miami corpus actually consists of two sub-corpora - conversations which are predominantly Spanish, and conversations which are predominantly English.  The alpha files also used two marking systems (in one case, both in the same file!).  These factors are reflected in the directroy structure for alpha: 2 contains files using the 023 tags, predominantly English; 3 contains files using the 023 tags, predominantly Spanish; en contains files using the en/es tags, predominantly English; 3 contains files using the en/es tags, predominantly Spanish.  The beta files all use the 3-letter tags, but they are in two folders: eng for predominantly English conversations, adn spa for predominantly Spanish.

Files which have been autoglossed and require checking are in the eng and spa folders at the top level.  Each chat file has an accompanying pdf file to simplify checking.  Please mark corrections on the pdf and place it in my pigeon-hole for processing.

The ready_for_release folder will contain files that have been autoglossed and checked - the filename has _rc suffixed.  Manual changes can be made to these files if necessary - just send me the corrected copy of the file.
